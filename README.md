# ISSOtm's AUR packages

This repo contains [PKGBUILDs](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD) for [packages I maintain](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=ISSOtm) or [co-maintain](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=c&K=ISSOtm).
This is set up using [`aurpublish`](https://github.com/eli-schwartz/aurpublish).

I also use this repo as CI for contributing to PKGBUILDs I don't necessarily maintain.
